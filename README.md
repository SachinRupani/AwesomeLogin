# AwesomeLogin - React Native

Here is a simple, elegant and a beautiful login screen created using react native. Special thanks to [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) and [react-native-paper](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper) package, with the help of which I was able to create this awesome login page.

###### Key Points

-A login page created using react native (react JS).

-It supports the dark mode as well.
